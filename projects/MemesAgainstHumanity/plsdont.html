    <title>Add your own meme!</title>

<body>
    <p>Since I can't remember every single meme off the top of my head, you can suggest some! Simply fill out the poorly and lazily made form below and press the lazily and poorly made submit button to submit it. <br /><br /><b>There are a few rules though:</b><br />1. No inside jokes - Make sure everyone will be able to understand it<br />2. It needs to be funny - I mean, if a meme isn't funny, then its just a bad joke.<br />3. Fill out the form correctly - <span title="Or is it...?">It's pretty straightfoward.</span></p>
